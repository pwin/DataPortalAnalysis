# DataPortalAnalysis
#### Analysis of RDF predicates used in European Data Portals

The point of this is to see how often a set of predicates occur in the portals and to find the classes of the subject and object when these are present

The lists of predicates are in the 2 python files

There is a results file from 2019-03-14 for the following 2 portals:

- [https://www.europeandataportal.eu](https://www.europeandataportal.eu)
- [http://data.europa.eu/euodp](http://data.europa.eu/euodp)

The output is XML.  The stylesheet (output2html.xsl) converts this to a simple HTML format
